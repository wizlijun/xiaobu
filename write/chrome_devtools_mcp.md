Published: September 23, 2025

We're launching today a public preview for the new Chrome DevTools Model Context Protocol (MCP) server, bringing the power of Chrome DevTools to AI coding assistants.

Coding agents face a fundamental problem: they are not able to see what the code they generate actually does when it runs in the browser. They're effectively programming with a blindfold on.

The Chrome DevTools MCP server changes this. AI coding assistants are able to debug web pages directly in Chrome, and benefit from DevTools debugging capabilities and performance insights. This improves their accuracy when identifying and fixing issues.

See for yourself how it works: 

What is the Model Context Protocol (MCP)?
The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open-source standard for connecting large language models (LLMs) to external tools and data sources. The Chrome DevTools MCP server adds debugging capabilities to your AI agent.

For example, the Chrome DevTools MCP server provides a tool called performance_start_trace. When tasked to investigate the performance of your website, an LLM can use this tool to start Chrome, open your website and use Chrome DevTools to record a performance trace. The LLM can then analyze the performance trace to suggest potential improvements. Using the MCP protocol, the Chrome DevTools MCP server can bring new debugging capabilities to your coding agent to make it better at building websites.

If you want to find out more about how MCP works, check out the MCP documentation.

What can you use it for?
Following are a few example prompts you can try out in the AI assistant of your choice like Gemini CLI.

Verify code changes in real-time
Generate a fix with your AI agent, and then automatically verify that the solution works as intended with Chrome DevTools MCP.

Prompt to try:


Verify in the browser that your change works as expected.
Diagnose network and console errors
Empower your agent to analyze network requests to uncover CORS issues or inspect console logs to understand why a feature isn't working as expected.

Prompt to try:


A few images on localhost:8080 are not loading. What's happening?
Simulate user behavior
Navigate, fill out forms, and click buttons to reproduce bugs and test complex user flowsâ€”all while inspecting the runtime environment.

Prompt to try:


Why does submitting the form fail after entering an email address?
Debug live styling and layout issues
Ask your AI agent to connect to a live page, inspect the DOM and CSS, and get concrete suggestions to fix complex layout problems like overflowing elements based on live data from the browser.

Prompt to try:


The page on localhost:8080 looks strange and off. Check what's happening there.
Automate performance audits
Instruct your AI agent to run a performance trace, analyze the results, and investigate specific performance issues like high LCP numbers.

Prompt to try:


Localhost:8080 is loading slowly. Make it load faster.
See our tool reference documentation for a list of all available tools.

Get started
To try this out, add the following config entry to your MCP client:


{
  "mcpServers": {
    "chrome-devtools": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["chrome-devtools-mcp@latest"]
    }
  }
}

To check if it works, run the following prompt in your coding agent:


Please check the LCP of web.dev.
For more details, check out the Chrome DevTools MCP documentation on GitHub.

Get involved
We are building Chrome DevTools MCP incrementally, starting with the public preview version we're releasing today. We're actively looking for feedback from you and the community about which capabilities we should add next. Whether you're a developer using AI coding assistants or a vendor building the next generation of AI development tools, your insights will be invaluable and if something is missing or not working, please file an issue on GitHub.
